\begin{abstract}
Servers commonly rely on the SSH protocol to ensure secure communication and activity between authorized clients and host machines. It is widely known that insecure hosts are easily vulnerable to the simple yet effective SSH brute force attack, and most well-configured servers take the proper security steps to protect themselves. The tool irpSSHa goes a step beyond ensuring protection to an administrator's own host by helping users identify abusive IP addresses engaging in such attacks and submitting data to a public trustworthy blacklist. Using datasets containing formatted IP flow log entries as input, irpSSHa identifies potential attackers and cross references these findings with the public blacklist database AbuseIPDB. It then presents this data to the user and allows for automatic and accurate reporting of malicious IPs to AbuseIPDB. A preliminary evaluation proves irpSSHa successful in identifying hundreds of potential attackers and providing the functionality to report them immediately with ease.
