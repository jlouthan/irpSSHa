\section{Conclusions}
Even with all the proper security measures in place, a host with a public IP still faces the reality of being throttled with SSH brute force attack attempts. If an administrator or other user wants to take the next step and contribute toward ensuring security for all, irpSSHa can be used to efficiently analyze IP flow logs for a secured destination with simple SQL queries to identify potentially abusive source IP addresses, and supply an easy to use interface for reporting these IPs to a reputable public blacklist. A preliminary evaluation shows that irpSSHa is very successful in identifying malicious IPs with a pattern of abusive behavior consistent with SSH brute force attackers.
